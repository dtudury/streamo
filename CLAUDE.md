# streamo — Claude context

## what this project is

`@dtudury/streamo` is a peer-to-peer sync library with a reactive UI layer. The central
promise: no server holds authority over your data or your identity. Keys are derived
deterministically from credentials (no files to manage), every write is signed and
append-only, and the server is a relay — not a gatekeeper.

## relay & process config — the canonical home for "how is this thing run"

When you're spinning up a relay or author-process via `bin/streamo.js` and
wondering "is there a config file shape for this?" — yes. See
**`design.md` §14.5 — Relay configuration: `--config`, the four-way matrix,
and `homeKey` as canonical anchor**. That section documents:

- The four input sources with precedence: CLI > env > config file > defaults
- The `streamo.json` config-file shape (`identity` + `server` sub-objects)
  — distinct from the Record-side `streamo.json` that fileSync writes
- **`homeKey`** as the canonical name for "the pubkey of the Record this
  process is opening" (from `bin/streamo.js` line ~219, verbatim)
- Author mode (sign your own) vs. relay-only mode (mirror by `homeKey`)
- Sample configs: `env/example.library-publisher.json`,
  `env/example.homepage-relay.json`

When David or future-iris asks *"isn't there a canonical field somewhere?"*
— that's the `homeKey` field, and §14.5 is the home for the discussion.

## the face of the project

These files are how people discover and understand streamo. Keep them in sync
after any meaningful change — not as an afterthought, but as part of the work:

- **`README.md`** — npm/GitHub landing page; imports, framing, and examples must reflect
  the current package name (`@dtudury/streamo`) and current capabilities
- **`public/homepage/index.html`** — browser homepage, served from the home repo's
  `files` key via `fileSync` (page-as-Record). Feature list and app cards should match
  the README's framing. Edit on disk → signed commit lands → next request serves the
  new bytes
- **`package.json`** — version, name (`@dtudury/streamo`), description, and keywords;
  version bumps immediately after the user says they've published
- **`ROADMAP.md`** — public on GitHub; future-focused — what's next + known limitations
  + beyond 1.0. Move items done into CHANGELOG; keep the menu of future threads current
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — public on GitHub; release-by-release narrative history.
  When a version ships, move the "where we are" entry from ROADMAP into a new top
  section here
- **`dear-future-claudes.md`** — style preferences the partner has named clearly,
  written as notes from one Claude session to the next. Check it when starting
  new code — it's where the "h-templates inline, forms with onsubmit, mount the
  whole body" convention lives. Add to it when a new preference is named

Stale public-facing docs erode trust faster than bugs do.

## publish rhythm

The user publishes to npm manually and notifies Claude when done. The moment they say
they've published, bump the patch version in `package.json`, commit, and push — before
starting any other work. This ritual matters to them.

## language and framing

Use this framing consistently across all public-facing text:

1. **No server holds authority** — the server is a relay, not a gatekeeper
2. **Your identity travels with you** — same credentials, same keypair, everywhere; no
   key files, no seed phrases, no backup ritual
3. **Every write is provably yours** — signed commits, append-only, permanent
4. **Content-addressed** — data identified by what it is, not where it lives

"Content-addressed" is technically important but not the lead. Start with ownership.

## package surface

- **`index.js`** — main barrel; `import { StreamoRecord, WritableStreamoRecord, Signer, registrySync } from '@dtudury/streamo'`.
  Excludes `StreamoComponent` (extends `HTMLElement`, browser-only — subpath-import it from
  `'@dtudury/streamo/StreamoComponent.js'`).
- **`exports` map** — `"."` → `index.js`; `"./*"` → `./public/streamo/*` so subpath imports
  shed the `public/streamo/` prefix.
- **`files` field** — positive list with negations; tests, `utils/testing.js`, and
  `utils/mockDOM.js` are excluded from the npm tarball.

## quality gate

There is no CI. Run `npm test` (which is `node --test`) before any commit that touches code
— the user's standing arrangement is "Claude is the gate." 79+ tests, ~2.3s. If a change
lands without tests passing, you have failed the contract.

## known footguns

- **`registry._materialize(key)` is local; `session.subscribe(key)` is the wire.**
  Closed-loop in 10.0: the old `registry.open` is now `_materialize` (underscored
  because client code almost never wants it). `_materialize` ensures a local
  Record exists for that pubkey — idempotent, doesn't touch the network, used
  internally by the registry's chunk-arrival path and by the relay's startup
  seed. **Client code that wants bytes to flow wants `session.subscribe(key)`**,
  which materializes locally AND sends a `subscribe` JSON over the WS so the
  relay starts pushing bytes. The cascading `follow` callback in
  `registrySync(...)` is the content-driven sibling — subscribe-by-discovery
  via a watcher on a known record's value (`home.flashcardsDecks`,
  `home.members`, etc.) instead of subscribe-by-explicit-call.

  If you find yourself reaching for `registry._materialize` outside the
  registry, the relay's seed step, or the explorer's startup-from-disk path,
  you're probably writing a bug — use `session.subscribe` or wire a `follow`
  cascade instead.
- **Slim `StreamoRecord` has no author methods.** Calling `.set`, `.setRefs`,
  `.commit`, `.checkout`, `.merge`, `.update`, `.attachSigner`, or `.sign` on a
  slim StreamoRecord raises `TypeError` — they live on `WritableStreamoRecord`,
  the subclass you opt into when you intend to author. The discriminator is
  the registry's factory: the canonical pattern is `key === myKey ? new
  WritableStreamoRecord(...) : new StreamoRecord(...)`. `session.subscribe`
  returns whatever the factory produced, so an app that intends to author to
  its own key must declare it Writable in the factory BEFORE the subscribe
  materializes it. The type-level guard is load-bearing — `registrySync.subscribe`'s
  outbound reader checks `repo instanceof WritableStreamoRecord` and skips
  reader setup for slim Records (no signer, no business pushing). This is
  what dissolves the watch.js corruption-fight footgun architecturally; don't
  defeat it by making everything Writable "just in case."
- **`onclick=${fn}` in h templates is a trap.** `attr=${fn}` is the *reactive
  cell* pattern: mount calls `fn(el)` on every render and assigns the **return
  value** to the attribute. For onclick this means the "handler" runs on every
  mount and `el.onclick` becomes `undefined`. **The fix is `handle`** from
  `h.js`: `onclick=${handle(fn)}` produces the right curry shape
  (`el => event => fn(event, el)`) without double-arrow noise. For no-args
  handlers: `onclick=${handle(() => doThing(id))}`. The journal app still
  uses the older `onclick=${() => fn}` double-arrow shim that predates
  `handle` — both work; `handle` reads better. **Event delegation** with
  `data-action` attributes on a single listener at the app container (see
  `public/apps/explorer/main.js`) is still the right call for genuinely
  large or uniform dynamic lists, but it's a separate tool — not the
  universal escape hatch from this footgun.
- **One Recaller per app.** A Recaller is meant to be the shared
  coordination point: data sources fire on it, views watch on it,
  the `(target, key)` NestedSet keeps unrelated subsystems from
  colliding. The streamo idiom: `new StreamoRecordRegistry({
  recaller })` makes the default factory create slim StreamoRecords
  that *share* the recaller, so reading any record's state inside a
  slot self-subscribes the slot. App UI state, async caches (verify),
  and toggle state (trees) each become their own `liveObject(target,
  { recaller })` — different targets, same recaller, no collisions.
  `defineComponent(name, fn, { recaller })` does the same for custom-
  element components: pass the app's Recaller and the component's
  cells compose with app state instead of isolating.
- **Function components without `data-key` fresh-mount on every parent
  re-render.** `<${MyComponent} ...prop=${x}/>` produces an HElement
  whose `tag` is a function. Mount's recycler matches by string tag
  or by `data-key`; a function tag with no key doesn't match the pool,
  so the existing DOM (and its watchers, focus, scroll, partial input)
  is torn down and the component is freshly invoked. Add `data-key=${id}`
  to the invocation to enroll it in recycling — the previous DOM
  survives, the function gets called with new props, attrs/children
  reconcile in place. **Rule of thumb: any function-component
  invocation that appears in a list, or whose inner DOM holds state,
  needs a `data-key`.**
- **Recycling-by-tag can mix semantically different elements.** Two
  `<input>` siblings in the same parent are interchangeable to mount
  unless they're keyed. If a re-render swaps `<input name="username">`
  for `<input class="new-todo">`, mount happily mutates the existing
  input's attrs in place — same DOM node, totally different meaning.
  Browser side-effects of "fresh insertion" (autofocus, password
  manager attribution) don't fire. **Add `data-key` whenever two
  semantically distinct elements share a tag in the same slot.**
- **Returning `false` from an `on*` handler is silent `preventDefault` —
  defanged by `handle()`.** Mount assigns event handlers as DOM Level 0
  properties (`el.onkeydown = fn`). Per HTML spec, if such a handler returns
  `false`, the browser treats it as `event.preventDefault()`. The trap
  surfaces when you write a short-circuit expression body like
  `e => e.key === 'Escape' && cancelEdit()` — for any non-Escape key, the
  expression evaluates to `false` and the handler returns it. On an
  `<input>`'s `onkeydown`, that prevents the character from being inserted;
  typing silently does nothing.
  **`handle()` from `h.js` dissolves this trap** — its wrapper has a
  block body (`event => { fn(event, element) }`) that discards the inner
  return value, so handle()-wrapped handlers always return `undefined`
  regardless of what your fn returns. *If you write event handlers
  through `handle()`, this footgun does not apply.* If you explicitly
  want `preventDefault`, call `event.preventDefault()`.
  *Older code using the `onclick=${() => fn}` double-arrow shim (e.g.,
  the journal app) is still vulnerable; for those, use a block body that
  returns `undefined`:* `e => { if (e.key === 'Escape') cancelEdit() }`.

## architecture notes

- `Streamo` — content-addressable codec. `set(value)→address`, `get(address)→value`,
  same value → same address. Decomposes structured values into reusable chunks; chunks
  reference each other by byte-offset address. Hash-chain (chainHash) folds over the byte
  stream; SIG chunks anchor it. Identity-blind — knows nothing about signatures,
  authors, or chains.
- `StreamoRecord` (slim) — extends Streamo with the chain-interpretation lens: "this
  Streamo's bytes interpret as a signed chain." Read-only definitional minimum:
  chain reads (`lastCommit`, `committedChainHash`, `signedLength`, `valueAddress`,
  `get`, `getRefs`, `files`, `history`, `verify`), wire-state cells (`hasRelay`,
  `caughtUpToRelay`, `isReadyToAuthor`, `pushRejected`, `conflictDetected`,
  `relayChainHash`), `_attachSession`, and the `makeRelayInboundStream` delegate
  (trust+append for the receive-from-relay path, with a chain-hash-equality
  alignment check that catches the push-in-flight race). Paired with
  `StreamoRecordSerializer` on the relay side — the per-record chain authority
  that atomically accepts or rejects incoming pushes against the current
  `committedChainHash`.
- `WritableStreamoRecord` — extends slim with the author surface: `attachSigner`,
  `set`, `setRefs`, `checkout`, `commit`, `merge`, `update`, `sign`,
  `defaultMessage`, plus `locallyAuthoredOffset` (the substrate's word for
  "which bytes did I sign for this session"). The type-level split is what
  makes the observer-doesn't-push guard load-bearing. Vocabulary: *fork* =
  new Record with a lineage note; *branch* = an addressed-but-non-head value
  inside a Record; *conflict* = the runtime "these bytes can't be appended"
  failure; *merge* = a commit citing prior values.
- `Signer` — deterministic secp256k1 keypairs via PBKDF2-SHA256 (256 bits, `deriveBits`)
  from username + password. KAT in `Signer.test.js` pins the bytes — do not change the
  derivation without updating the KAT and acknowledging it as a breaking change.
- `Recaller` — fine-grained reactive dependency tracker; `watch(name, f)` / `unwatch(f)`
- `h` — tagged template literal HTML parser → HElement / HText virtual tree
- `mount` — reactive DOM renderer; slots are reactive cells; elements recycled by
  `data-key` then tag on re-render; removed nodes cleaned up via `recaller.unwatch()`;
  exports `dismount(root, recaller)` for custom element cleanup
- `StreamoComponent` — base class for hot-reloadable custom elements; `componentKey`
  generates address-based names; `defineComponent` registers render functions; function
  components `(props) => nodes` work directly as tags in `h` with no class needed
- `registrySync` — bidirectional multi-repo sync over a single WebSocket; works in Node
  and browser; content-driven discovery via `follow`; sends 20-second JSON keep-alive
  pings so idle-closing PaaS hosts don't drop the connection
- CLI `--web` flag — starts a WebSocket relay + static file server; `chat-server.js` is
  retired; `public/apps/chat/cli.js` is the terminal chat client
- `public/apps/chat/server.js` is the **all-in-one demo / production server** —
  chat room + static files for homepage + chat + explorer, on one port. `npm run
  dev` runs it with `env/dev.env`; `npm run prod` runs it with `env/prod.env`.

## what's next

1. Polish the explorer further — richer commit view (signature chunks as their own
   entries, changed-paths highlight between commit and parent, collapsible JSON tree)
2. Presence indicators — heartbeat already exists at the WS level (keep-alive ping in
   `registrySync`); the missing piece is surfacing "who's online" in the UI via the
   `interest`/`announce` ephemeral layer

## commit style

Commit and push at the end of every response that makes a change. Over-commit rather
than over-think. Co-author line on every commit:
